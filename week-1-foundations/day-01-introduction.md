# Day 1 – Introduction to Data Engineering

## Goal of the Day
To understand what data engineering is, what a data engineer does, and how it differs from other data-related roles.

## What is Data Engineering?

Data engineering is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining systems that collect, process, and store data so that it can be used reliably by people and applications.

A data engineer focuses on:
- Moving data from source to destination
- Making sure data is clean, accurate, and reliable
- Building pipelines that run repeatedly without breaking

In simple terms:

A data engineer makes sure the right data gets to the right place, in the right format, at the right time.

## Where Data Engineering Fits

In a typical organisation:
- Data engineers build the pipelines
- Data analysts use clean data to create reports and insights
- Data scientists use data to build models and predictions

Without data engineering, the other roles cannot work effectively.

## Data Engineer vs Other Roles

### Data Engineer
- Builds data pipelines
- Handles large and messy datasets
- Focuses on reliability and structure
- Works mostly on the backend

### Data Analyst
- Uses existing data
- Creates reports and dashboards
- Answers business questions

### Data Scientist
- Builds predictive models
- Uses statistics and machine learning
- Focuses on future trends

---

## Why Data Pipelines Exist

Raw data is often:
- Incomplete
- Inconsistent
- Stored in different formats
- Generated by different systems

Data pipelines exist to:
- Collect data
- Clean and transform it
- Store it in a usable format
- Make it trustworthy

---

## Real-World Examples

Examples of data engineering work include:
- Processing daily sales transactions
- Cleaning customer data from multiple systems
- Preparing data for monthly financial reports
- Feeding data into analytics dashboards

---

## Key Takeaways
- Data engineering is about systems, not just data
- Clean data is more valuable than large amounts of bad data
- Reliability and consistency are core responsibilities
- Data engineers enable other data roles to succeed

## Reflection

In your own words, answer the following:
- What does a data engineer do?
- Why is data engineering important in organisations?
- Which part of data engineering sounds most interesting to you?
