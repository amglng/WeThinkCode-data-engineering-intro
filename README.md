# WeThinkCode-data-engineering-intro
A 2-week foundational introduction to Data Engineering aligned with the WeThinkCode_ Data Engineering elective. Covers data formats, batch processing, simple data pipelines, and data quality using Python

---

## Week 1 — Foundations

### Day 1: Introduction to Data Engineering
- What data engineering is
- Differences between data engineering, data analysis, and data science
- Why data pipelines exist

### Day 2: Data Lifecycle
- Data sources and ingestion
- Raw vs processed data
- How data moves from source to consumption

### Day 3: Data Formats (CSV & JSON)
- Understanding tabular vs structured data
- Reading CSV and JSON files using Python

### Day 4: Batch Processing
- What batch processing is
- Why organisations rely on batch jobs
- Processing data in chunks

### Day 5: Data Cleaning Basics
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Basic error handling

---

## Week 2 — Pipelines & Reliability

### Day 6: Data Pipelines
- Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
- Why pipelines must be reliable

### Day 7: Simple Batch Pipeline
A Python pipeline that:
1. Reads raw CSV data  
2. Cleans and transforms it  
3. Outputs a clean dataset  

### Day 8: Batch vs Streaming
- Differences between batch and streaming processing
- Real-world examples

### Day 9: Data Quality & Integrity
- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Consistency

### Day 10: Monitoring & Reliability
- What happens when pipelines fail
- Importance of logs and retries

## Mini Project — Sales Data Pipeline

### Project Description
A simple batch data pipeline that processes fictional sales data.

The pipeline:
- Reads raw sales data
- Cleans invalid or missing records
- Outputs a clean dataset
- Produces basic summary statistics

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- CSV & JSON file handling
- No external frameworks (focus on fundamentals)

---
